What?!
You dare utter such treacherous words before us? 
There is no such thing as too much preparation!
Our lands, bordering the Licorice Sea, cannot be sufficiently defended even with all of our forces
With the banishment of the First Watcher, our forces' morale is at an all time low.
What if ferocious beasts were to attack at this very moment? 
I will not be subject to such an accusation!
